"""
Streaming CSV exporter for ticket audits (issue #3901).

Tickets are serialized one batch at a time and yielded as CSV text, so admin
audits can download very large exports without buffering the whole dataset in
memory. Cell values are sanitized against CSV/formula-injection payloads.

Run with:  python -m unittest backend.tests.test_csv_exporter -v
